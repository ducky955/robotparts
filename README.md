# Here is the rundown of what I'm doing:
I'm creating a wifi based tex display, which displays a message based on a local server I host. To do this, I will be using wifi enabled microcontrolers to pull messages from text.![alt text](IMG_2306.jpg)

The microcontroller pulls a message off a local server, and onto the lcd screen. A light is used to indicate connection to wifi. I'm thinking about using buttons to put the device into sleep mode, to save energy.

## What is done so far?

I have the basic framework of how this project will work. I will be creating the code for Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32, and other microcontrollers.
